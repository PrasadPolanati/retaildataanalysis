Overall Strategy Recommendations:
Targeted Marketing Campaigns:

Use insights from both datasets to create personalized marketing strategies, including re-engagement campaigns for "At Risk" and "New Customers", loyalty-building efforts for "Champions" and "Loyal Customers", and retention strategies for "Hibernating" customers.
Optimize Customer Journey:

Implement personalized product recommendations and promotions based on customer segmentation from the RFM model and product purchasing patterns from the e-commerce dataset.
Improved Inventory Management:

Use customer purchasing behavior (from the e-commerce dataset) to inform demand forecasting and ensure optimal inventory levels, particularly for frequently purchased items.
Loyalty and Retention Strategies:

Leverage the RFM model to identify high-value customers and tailor retention strategies (e.g., loyalty rewards) to these segments, while simultaneously addressing churn risk in segments like "At Risk" and "Hibernating".
